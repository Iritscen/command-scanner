# CommandScanner
Pass a Bash script to CommandScanner and the commands that the script uses will be compared against the commands that are built into the macOS command line. You will be notified if any commands are not built-in.

You will likely have to edit the arrays of known commands at the top of the script, and possibly some of the parsing code as well, in order to adapt them to your personal scripting style and shell environment.
